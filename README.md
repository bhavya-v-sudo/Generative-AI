# Generative-AI

## Excel-QA-Generator
This Python script leverages Google's generative AI to answer questions about companies based on their names, using data from an Excel sheet. The responses are then saved in another Excel sheet.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the required libraries installed:

#### pip install -U google-generativeai

## Configuration
Get your Google API key and securely store it in your Colab environment.
Update the file_path variable in the script to point to your Excel file.
python

### Specify the path to your Excel file
file_path = '/path/to/your/excel/file.xlsx'

## Usage
Run the script in a Google Colab environment.
The script reads company names from the specified Excel file, sends queries to Google's generative AI, and updates the Excel sheet with the generated answers.
The output is saved to a new Excel file.

## Notes
Google API Key: Ensure you have a valid Google API key, and it is securely stored.
Model: The script uses the 'gemini-pro' model for content generation.
